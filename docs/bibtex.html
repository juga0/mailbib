  abstract = {This memo defines a MIME content-type that may be used by a mail user agent (MUA) or electronic mail gateway to report the disposition of a message after it has been successfully delivered to a recipient. This content-type is intended to be machine-processable. Additional message headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message. The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary &quot;LAN-based&quot; systems, and often referred to as &quot;read receipts,&quot; &quot;acknowledgements&quot;, or &quot;receipt notifications.&quot; The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary &quot;LAN-based&quot; systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of &quot;foreign&quot; addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may also be defined to support &quot;tunneling&quot; of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},

They are often assembled by merging multiple certificates that all share the same primary key, and are distributed in public keystores. Unfortunately, since many keystores permit any third-party to add a certification with any content to any OpenPGP certificate, the assembled/merged form of a certificate can become unwieldy or undistributable. Furthermore, keystores that are searched by user ID can be made unusable for specific names or addresses by public submission of bogus data. And finally, keystores open to public submission can also face simple resource exhaustion from flooding with bogus submissions, or legal or other risks from uploads of toxic data. This draft documents techniques that an archive of OpenPGP certificates can use to mitigate the impact of these various attacks.},

  abstract = {An e-mail message with OpenPGP encryption and/or signature has standard form. However, some mail transport agents damage those forms in transit. A user-friendly mail user agent that encounters such a mangled message may wish to try to process it anyway, despite the message's non-standard structure. This document aims to be a sort of bestiary of common message mangling patterns, along with guidance for implementers for how to cope with messages structured in these common ways.},

  title = {{DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) Signatures}},
  howpublished = {RFC 6376},
  month = {September},
  year = {2011},
  abstract = {DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, or organization that owns the signing domain to claim some responsibility for a message by associating the domain with the message. This can be an author's organization, an operational relay, or one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identity of the Signer of the message from the purported author of the message. Assertion of responsibility is validated through a cryptographic signature and by querying the Signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author to recipient is through relays that typically make no substantive change to the message content and thus preserve the DKIM signature. This memo obsoletes RFC 4871 and RFC 5672. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

This document specifies a DANE method for publishing and locating OpenPGP public keys in DNS for a specific email address using a new OPENPGPKEY DNS resource record.
