This content-type is intended to be machine-processable. Additional message headers are also defined to permit Message Disposition Notifications (MDNs) to be requested by the sender of a message. The purpose is to extend Internet Mail to support functionality often found in other messaging systems, such as X.400 and the proprietary &quot;LAN-based&quot; systems, and often referred to as &quot;read receipts,&quot; &quot;acknowledgements&quot;, or &quot;receipt notifications.&quot; The intention is to do this while respecting privacy concerns, which have often been expressed when such functions have been discussed in the past. Because many messages are sent between the Internet and other messaging systems (such as X.400 or the proprietary &quot;LAN-based&quot; systems), the MDN protocol is designed to be useful in a multi-protocol messaging environment. To this end, the protocol described in this memo provides for the carriage of &quot;foreign&quot; addresses, in addition to those normally used in Internet Mail. Additional attributes may also be defined to support &quot;tunneling&quot; of foreign notifications through Internet Mail. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},

Unfortunately, since many keystores permit any third-party to add a certification with any content to any OpenPGP certificate, the assembled/merged form of a certificate can become unwieldy or undistributable. Furthermore, keystores that are searched by user ID can be made unusable for specific names or addresses by public submission of bogus data. And finally, keystores open to public submission can also face simple resource exhaustion from flooding with bogus submissions, or legal or other risks from uploads of toxic data.
